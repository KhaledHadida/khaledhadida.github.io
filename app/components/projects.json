This is a trading game I started making in January 2025, after an inspiration I took while attending a friend`s LAN party, one of my buddies was playing Balatro, I wanted to make a game where you are rewarded for combining things, but I also wanted the game to be realistic, thus I made a game that`s set in the days of old Silk Road. In this game you must meet your gold target otherwise you lose, and you gain gold through buying & combining items or treasures. Avoid bandits all time!"
